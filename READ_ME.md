# How To Run
1. Import as IntelliJ project (as that what we developed on)
2. Import JUnit as necessary (since we run our tests using JUnit)
3. Might need to increase JVM memory/thread limit (some of our test cases exceed the amount but should have no problems through at least 25 vertex graph)

# Notes
1. TCPProcess and ShortestPathTCPTest are the files for our most recent implementation and tests
2. There also exists Bellman_Ford_Process and ShortestPathTest which are older versions using RMI
